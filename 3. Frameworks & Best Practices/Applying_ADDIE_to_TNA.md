# Applying the ADDIE Model to Training Needs Analysis (TNA)

The ADDIE model—Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, Evaluate—is a foundational framework in instructional design. It provides a systematic approach for building effective learning experiences, and it aligns naturally with the Training Needs Analysis (TNA) process.

While TNA is most closely associated with the **Analyze** phase, its findings directly inform every other stage of the ADDIE cycle. By grounding each step in accurate, data-driven insights from the TNA, instructional designers can ensure that training interventions are both targeted and impactful.

## How TNA Supports Each Phase of ADDIE

### Analyze
- Identify the root causes of performance problems
- Clarify the training request and define measurable performance gaps
- Gather and interpret qualitative and quantitative data
- Align identified needs with business goals and strategic initiatives

### Design
- Translate findings from the TNA into clear learning objectives
- Select appropriate instructional strategies and delivery modalities
- Plan assessment methods to measure success based on needs data

### Develop
- Create or source content and materials that directly address the gaps identified in the TNA
- Ensure accessibility, inclusiveness, and alignment with stakeholder expectations
- Build job aids, eLearning modules, facilitator guides, and other assets tied to performance outcomes

### Implement
- Deliver training using the modalities identified during design
- Coordinate scheduling, facilitators, technology platforms, and support resources
- Communicate expectations to learners and stakeholders using data from the original analysis

### Evaluate
- Measure outcomes using key performance indicators and feedback loops established during the analysis and design phases
- Assess training effectiveness at multiple levels (e.g., reaction, learning, behavior, results)
- Revisit initial performance gaps to determine if desired outcomes were achieved

## Summary

Using ADDIE alongside a well-structured TNA strengthens the instructional design process by ensuring that each phase is grounded in real organizational need. The result is a more targeted, efficient, and effective training solution—one that drives measurable improvement and supports long-term performance goals.

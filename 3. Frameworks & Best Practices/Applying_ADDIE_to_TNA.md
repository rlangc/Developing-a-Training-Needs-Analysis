# Applying the ADDIE Model to TNA

The ADDIE framework (Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, Evaluate) offers a structured process for instructional design. TNA naturally aligns with the **Analyze** phase but informs all subsequent phases:
- **Analyze**: Identify performance gaps and root causes
- **Design**: Develop objectives and determine delivery methods
- **Develop**: Create learning materials based on TNA data
- **Implement**: Deliver the solution using defined modalities
- **Evaluate**: Assess outcomes based on the original TNA findings

# 508 Compliance Considerations in Training Needs Analysis (TNA)

Accessibility is a critical consideration in any training initiative, and it should be built into the Training Needs Analysis (TNA) process from the outset. Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires that all electronic and information technology developed, procured, maintained, or used by federal agencies be accessible to people with disabilities. This principle extends to training tools, environments, and content.

Incorporating 508 compliance into your TNA ensures that all learners can access and benefit from the training solutions you recommend. Failing to consider accessibility can result in exclusion, inequity, and legal risk.

## Why Accessibility Matters in TNA

- **Equity and Inclusion:** Everyone should have equal access to learning, regardless of ability.
- **Legal and Policy Requirements:** Public sector and federally funded organizations are bound by 508 and WCAG 2.1 standards.
- **Improved User Experience:** Accessible design benefits all learners, not just those with disabilities.
- **Performance and Participation:** Accessibility increases engagement, comprehension, and the success of your training program.

## Key Accessibility Actions During TNA

### Assess Accessibility of Data Collection Methods
- Ensure all surveys, assessments, and interviews are usable by individuals using assistive technologies.
- Use accessible forms and provide alternate formats (e.g., screen reader–friendly surveys or verbal participation options).
- Test for keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and color contrast.

### Include Accessibility in Training Requirements
- Add accessibility as a formal requirement when documenting training needs.
- Include it in stakeholder interviews, SME conversations, and RFPs (if outsourcing).
- Consider 508 compliance during software/tool selection.

### Document Accommodations and Support Services
- Identify the need for interpreters, closed captioning, transcripts, alt text, and navigation assistance.
- Plan for accessible learning paths, including time extensions or alternative assessment formats.

### Evaluate Learning Technologies for 508/WCAG Compliance
- Use accessibility checklists when evaluating LMSs, authoring tools, and media platforms.
- Ask vendors for VPATs (Voluntary Product Accessibility Templates) to confirm conformance with 508 standards.
- Pilot content with users of diverse abilities before large-scale rollout.

### Build Accessibility Into the Final TNA Report
- Include an “Accessibility Considerations” section within your final TNA deliverable.
- Provide recommendations for universal design and inclusive learning strategies.
- Highlight risks and mitigations related to accessibility gaps.

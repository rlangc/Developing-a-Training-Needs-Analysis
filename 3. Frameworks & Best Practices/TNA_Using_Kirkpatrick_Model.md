# Using the Kirkpatrick Model in TNA

The Kirkpatrick Model provides a four-level framework to evaluate the effectiveness of training:
1. **Reaction** – How participants respond to the training
2. **Learning** – What knowledge or skills were acquired
3. **Behavior** – How learning is applied on the job
4. **Results** – The overall impact on organizational outcomes

This model can guide TNA by aligning analysis efforts with measurable outcomes at each level, ensuring training is designed with end results in mind.

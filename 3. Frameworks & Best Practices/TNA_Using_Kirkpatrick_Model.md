# Using the Kirkpatrick Model in Training Needs Analysis (TNA)

The Kirkpatrick Model is one of the most widely used frameworks for evaluating training effectiveness. It consists of four interconnected levels that measure different dimensions of training impact—from immediate learner reactions to long-term business results. While it is often applied after training has been delivered, it can also be a powerful guide during the **Training Needs Analysis (TNA)** process.

By aligning TNA efforts with Kirkpatrick’s four levels, instructional designers and analysts can ensure that training needs are clearly defined, strategically relevant, and tied to measurable outcomes.

## The Four Levels of the Kirkpatrick Model

### 1. Reaction
**Definition:** Measures how participants respond to the training experience.  
**Application in TNA:**  
- Gather input from employees, managers, and stakeholders on past or current training programs.
- Identify learner preferences, motivational barriers, and attitudes toward training formats.
- Use reaction data to inform delivery methods, engagement strategies, and learning environment design.

### 2. Learning
**Definition:** Assesses the degree to which learners have acquired intended knowledge, skills, or attitudes.  
**Application in TNA:**  
- Clarify the desired learning outcomes that address identified performance gaps.
- Evaluate current competency levels through assessments or performance reviews.
- Define clear, measurable learning objectives based on the skills or knowledge needed for improvement.

### 3. Behavior
**Definition:** Evaluates the extent to which learners apply what they learned on the job.  
**Application in TNA:**  
- Conduct job/task analyses to understand how behavior must change to meet performance expectations.
- Gather observational or supervisor feedback on current behavioral gaps.
- Identify environmental or cultural factors that support or inhibit the transfer of learning.

### 4. Results
**Definition:** Measures the ultimate impact of training on organizational outcomes (e.g., productivity, quality, sales, safety).  
**Application in TNA:**  
- Define strategic goals that training is intended to support.
- Work with business leaders to identify relevant performance indicators (KPIs).
- Establish baseline metrics to track progress after training is implemented.

## Benefits of Using Kirkpatrick During TNA

- Ensures that training needs are **clearly connected to business value**
- Promotes alignment between **training solutions and measurable impact**
- Encourages a **performance-first mindset** in training design
- Helps prioritize resources by focusing on **outcomes, not just activities**

| Kirkpatrick Level | TNA Focus Area                               | Example Data Source                     |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Reaction          | Learner expectations, format preferences     | Surveys, interviews, focus groups        |
| Learning          | Knowledge/skill gaps                         | Pre-tests, competency assessments        |
| Behavior          | On-the-job performance needs                 | Job analysis, manager feedback           |
| Results           | Organizational outcomes tied to performance  | KPIs, operational reports, ROI metrics   |

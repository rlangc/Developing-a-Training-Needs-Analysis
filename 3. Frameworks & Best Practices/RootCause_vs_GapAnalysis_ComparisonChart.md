| Feature               | Root Cause Analysis                  | Gap Analysis                            |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Focus                | Identifies underlying problem causes | Compares current vs. desired performance |
| Method               | Investigative (5 Whys, Fishbone)     | Analytical (skills, knowledge, outcomes) |
| Use in TNA           | Diagnose cause of poor performance   | Quantify and target learning gaps        |
| Outcome              | Informs if training is the right fix | Helps define the scope of the solution   |
